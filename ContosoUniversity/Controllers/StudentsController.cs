        //NOTE: The Views/Students/Index.cshtml view displays the student list in a table. The "async" keyword tells the compiler to generate callbacks for parts of the method body and to automatically create the Task<IActionResult> object that's returned.  The "await" keyword causes the compiler to split the method into two parts. The first part ends with the operation that's started asynchronously. The second part is put into a callback method that's called when the operation completes. The return type Tast<IActionResult> represents ongoing work with a result of type IActionResult. ToListAsync is the asynchronous version of the ToList extension method.

        //NOTE: When writing async code in Entity, only statements that cause queries or commands to be sent to the database are executed asynchronously. That includes ToListAsync, SingleOrDefaultAsync, and SaveChangesAsync. By contrast, statements that just change an IQueryable, such as var students = context.Students.Where(s => s.LastName == "something" do not.

Here, it returns a single Student object. Also, the "Include", ".ThenInclude" and "AsNoTracking" methods are added. Include and .ThenInclude cause the context to laod the Student.Enrollments navigation property (remember, navigation properties hint at foreign keys) and within each enrollment the Enrollment.Course navigation property. AsNoTracking improves performance in scenarios where the entities returned won't be updatd in the current context's lifetime.
